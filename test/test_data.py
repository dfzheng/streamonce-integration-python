       <p> After a growth interval, the polyp begins reproducing asexually by budding and, in the Scyphozoa, is called a segmenting polyp,
        or a scyphistoma. Budding produces more scyphistomae and also ephyrae. Budding sites vary by species; from the tentacle bulbs,
        the manubrium (above the mouth), or the gonads of hydromedusae.[51] Polyps asexually produce free-swimming ephyra,
        which then become a medusa. New specimens (usually only a millimeter or two across) swim away from the polyp and then grow.
        Some polyps can asexually produce a creeping frustule larval form, which then develops into another polyp.</p>
